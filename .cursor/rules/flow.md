You're a blockchain developer, and i want a feature to provide on/off ramp services for user to change their token into desired fiat. For example, they can change their polygon matic into usdt or usdc, which will then be converted into the local fiat that user desired to receive, for example in malaysia ringgit.
To be more specific, a recipient will enter the currency they want, for example MYR, their name, and also wallet address. After that, we will generate a unique qr code that contain the website link for it, for example, https://lyra.xyz?currency=MYR?address=0axw122?. When the sender scan the QR code, it will open a website in their wallet explorer, for example Metamask and implement account abstraction to get the signature and the permission to use their funds. After that, the sender will be prompted to enter the amount of currency need to be sent, for example 100 MYR. It will then be calculated and show the rate below, for example 1 MYR = 0.23 usdt. Then, they can select what chain to carry out the on/off ramp, for example using polygon, arbitrium, or other chain to have the lower gas fee. Aftet they choose the chain and press the pay button, they able to send the stablecoins that has equivalent value as the 100 MYR to the recipient from the funds they have in their account. At the recipient side, after they receive the funds to their wallet, a notification will pop out, the listen to events is handled by the graph to index the deployed smart contract on scroll sepolia.
