You're a blockchain developer, and i want a feature to provide on/off ramp services for user to change their token into desired fiat. For example, they can change their polygon matic into usdt or usdc, which will then be converted into the local fiat that user desired to receive, for example in malaysia ringgit.
To be more specific, a recipient will enter the currency they want, for example MYR, their name, and also wallet address. After that, we will generate a unique qr code that contain the website link for it, for example, https://lyra.xyz?currency=MYR?address=0axw122?. When the sender scan the QR code, it will open a website in their wallet explorer, for example Metamask and implement account abstraction to get the signature and the permission to use their funds. After that, the sender will be prompted to enter the amount of currency need to be sent, for example 100 MYR. It will then be calculated and show the rate below, for example 1 MYR = 0.23 usdt. Then, they can select what chain to carry out the on/off ramp, for example using polygon, arbitrium, or other chain to have the lower gas fee. Aftet they choose the chain and press the pay button, they able to send the stablecoins that has equivalent value as the 100 MYR to the recipient from the funds they have in their account. At the recipient side, after they receive the funds to their wallet, a notification will pop out, the listen to events is handled by the graph to index the deployed smart contract on scroll sepolia.

Updated flow:

1. Recipient provide desired currency, name and wallet address, after they provided, a qr code will be generated in frontend which consists of the parameter like domainName-sendFund/currency=MYR?...
2. Sender scan the QR, it redirect the sender to the domainName-sendFund with the corresponding parameter exists in the QR code, when the sender arrive at the page, they only required to enter the amount required, where the currency is already fixed stated in QR. Then, they will be allow to carry out on/off ramp by selecting different chain to change their token in their wallet into the usdt or usdc with equivalent value, after they press send, they web3 token is converted to stablecoins and sent to the recipient wallet address

The app flow will be as follow, there are three types of users in general

1. First type user will be government, government will swap their USDT on polygon chain or other token on polygon chain like POL to LYRA token on polygon chain, than the swapped LYRA will be transferred to recipients. Not sure it will be seperated into two step which is swap first in the first smart contract, then tranfer in the second smart contract or combine together to become one function
2. Second type of user will be residents, residents will use the LYRA token to carry out the transactions, so that the transactions is tracked, however, the LYRA token can only be sent to the selected merchant wallet address in order to ensure the fund spend is clean and trackable
3. Third type of user will be merchant, merchant will be generating the QR code, once residents scan the QR code, it will redirect residents to website link https://domain.name/recipientAddress=0xxx?amount=xx, at that website link, residensts is able to make payment to that merchant by tranferring the amount specified in the parameters. Merchant can also swap back the Lyra to USDT in order to withdraw their fund at the end of the day.
